This respository offers a set of solution algorithms in an board-side companion for the popular board game,
Camel-Cup. The game involves betting on camels as they race around the board. While very fun to play, the
game is almost purely statistical, and these codes hope to, in a sense, "solve" the game and calculate the
best move to play at any given game position.
